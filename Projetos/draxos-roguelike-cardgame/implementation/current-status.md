## Validation

```powershell
D:\Estudio\.local-tools\godot\4.6.2\Godot_v4.6.2-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path D:\Estudio\Projetos\draxos-roguelike-cardgame -s res://tools/validate.gd
```

## Next

Track 02 is ready for user playtest. Before the next broad card redesign batch, the recommended tooling step is reducing `card_focus_legal` ambiguity with an isolated capture mode that plays minimum support, plays the target card once, captures the signature and stops further card plays for that turn. Use `docs/playtest-track-02.md` for the human checklist and `tracks/track-02-complete-run-evolution/validation-and-tuning-notes.md` for Batch 01 and Card Impact V2 metrics, gates and known debt.
