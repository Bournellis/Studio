Stable registry of official projects and entrypoints. Portfolio status and allowed work live only in `../08_Coordenacao_Agentes/Prioridades_Estudio.md`; technical baselines live in each `implementation/current-status.md`.

## Registry

- `JogoDaCopa/`: PC Windows editor-first third-person football/minigames project. Entry: `AGENTS.md`; state: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `none`.
- `FpsPlayground/`: PC editor-first FPS laboratory. Entry: `AGENTS.md`; state: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `none`.
- `draxos-roguelike-cardgame/`: Steam/PC menu-first roguelike cardgame with ship hub, run map, Souls, relics and lane battles.
  Entry: `AGENTS.md`; state: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `shared`.

  Entry: `AGENTS.md`; state: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `shared`.
- `rpg-isometrico/`: campaign-first isometric action RPG. Product canon: `docs/canon/`; state: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `shared`.
- `rpg-turnos/`: turn-based exploration RPG-cardgame with independent mechanics. State: `implementation/current-status.md`; QA: `qa/QA_INDEX.md`; universe: `STUDIO_CORE.md` = `shared`.

## Routing

- football/Copa/ball/goals -> `JogoDaCopa/`
- FPS/arena/hitscan/jump pads -> `FpsPlayground/`
- roguelike/ship hub/run map/Souls/relics/lanes -> `draxos-roguelike-cardgame/`
- mobile/browser/Supabase/autobattler/Base/Internal Alpha -> `draxos-mobile/`
- isometric action campaign -> `rpg-isometrico/`
- turn-based board/card exploration -> `rpg-turnos/`

`Draxos` alone does not select a project. Confirm allowed work before opening deep documentation.

## Local-First Rule

Project work uses the target `08_Coordenacao/` for cards, triage and real handoffs.
Global coordination is reserved for portfolio sync, cross-project work and global governance.
Compact pre-cutover history is routed through History/ledgers and Documentation Lite receipts.
