# Current Status

## Metadata

- status: `paused`
- authority: `local_state`
- last_verified: `2026-07-17`
- review_when: `portfolio resumes the project or the runtime baseline changes`
- supersedes: `current-status.md before Governance v2`
- superseded_by: `none`

## Operational Snapshot

- Portfolio Status: `PAUSADO_INDEFINIDO`
- Portfolio Authority: `../../../08_Coordenacao_Agentes/Prioridades_Estudio.md`
- Preserved Track: `Track 02 - Draxos Lore And Progression Alignment`
- Track Result: `COMPLETE` through P20; no active implementation prompt or next track.

## Preserved Baseline

- Godot `4.6.2-stable`, GDScript, C1 as the sole runtime combat model.
- Playable slice includes class selection, exploration, six official battle modes, Invocador, Arcano, Necromante, rank progression, rewards and JSON save/load v2.
- P20 uses eight stable operation encounter IDs and migrates legacy v1 encounter references without mutating the source save data.
- Generated catalog is `data/generated/slice_catalog.tres`; authored source remains `data/definitions/slice_catalog.json`.

## Integrity Validation

- Automation: `GREEN` on `2026-07-16` with `249/249` tests and `954` asserts through `tools/validate.gd`.
- Repaired truncation in class deck initialization and world art-placeholder assembly.
- P19 catalog tests now validate resource objects correctly.
- Generated catalog was regenerated from the official JSON source and a repeated validation produced no additional tracked diff.
- Documentation NUL bytes removed from this snapshot and the Track 02 linear plan.
- Human playability was not revalidated; this repair does not approve feel, presentation, balance or product direction.

## Operational State

- Project remains `PAUSADO_INDEFINIDO`.
- No active gate, next track or authorized expansion.
- Future work requires an explicit portfolio-level resume decision.
