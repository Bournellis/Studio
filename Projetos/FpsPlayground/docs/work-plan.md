# FpsPlayground Work Plan

- Status: `FPS_PLAYGROUND_PROJECT_SPLIT_FOUNDATION_COMPLETE`
- Current surface: FPS arena lab.

## North Star

Keep `FpsPlayground` as a clean first-person gameplay laboratory for arena movement, shooting, projectiles, bots, maps and combat feel.

## Complete Baseline

- Project split from `FpsShooter` into `FpsPlayground`.
- Menu launches only `Arena Shooter`.
- Arena Shooter preserves the accepted `Duel Pit V2` baseline.
- Validation now targets FPS resources and arena tests only.
- Football/TPS scope moved to `../JogoDaCopa`.

## Recommended Next Track

Run a short editor regression on Arena Shooter after the split. Then choose between:

- deeper FPS bot/combat tuning;
- new arena map/layout;
- projectile/weapon experiment;
- export-readiness pass for the FPS lab.

## Out Of Scope

- Football minigames.
- TPS camera/avatar football work.
- Multiplayer/backend/export unless explicitly planned.
