## Metadata

Godot-first multi-project workspace for production, coordination and tooling. Shared lore is consumed from the separate Studio Core; this README carries no operational project state.

## Start Here

1. `AGENTS.md` - operational contract and hard stops.
2. `08_Coordenacao_Agentes/Prioridades_Estudio.md` - portfolio focus, status and allowed work.
3. `Projetos/README.md` - stable project registry and routing.
4. `08_Coordenacao_Agentes/Estado_Atual.md` - short portfolio projection.
5. Target project `AGENTS.md`, `implementation/current-status.md` and `08_Coordenacao/`.
6. `STUDIO_CORE.md` and the target project binding only when shared lore or universe membership is relevant.

## Structure

- `Projetos/`: official projects and read-only concept archives.
- `STUDIO_CORE.md`: bridge to the shared authority in `D:\Studio Core`.
- Project `STUDIO_CORE.md`: explicit universe binding and adopted domains.
- `canon/shared-lore/`: superseded provenance bridges retained for recovery.
- `canon/studio-conventions/`: explicit cross-project adoption boundaries.
- `08_Coordenacao_Agentes/`: global governance, portfolio sync, compact history, cleanup manifests and receipts.
- `materiais/`: supporting guides and non-canonical references.
- `tools/`: machine-readable governance, validation and worktree lifecycle.

Redundant pre-cutover coordination, lessons and migration notes are outside the normal search path after Documentation Lite v2.
Use project `implementation/history.md`, history ledgers, `08_Coordenacao_Agentes/History/` and the Documentation Lite receipts.
Recover exact removed sources only through the recorded Git baseline/tag.

## Boundaries

Only projects with `universe_binding: shared` adopt the declared Core domains. Product, gameplay, progression, architecture and platform contracts remain local unless the receiving project explicitly adopts a rule.

Codex performs only the safe routine `main` to `origin/main` Git synchronization
defined by `AGENTS.md` and its runbook. Release, product publication and every
other remote mutation remain Fabio-owned decisions.
